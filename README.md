LibBodyguard-1.0
================

A WoW AddOn library to query information about the player's current bodyguard (if any).

This is still in early progress, the plan is to be able to query any feasible information about bodyguards.

For now, only name, health and last known GUID are available.

Usage
-----

TODO: Add LuaDoc to code.

In the meantime, just examine the main.lua file, any public API methods are in the lib table.

To load library if you're using it embedded, specify the load.xml file in your TOC.

Use LibStub to consume the library in your WoW AddOns, just like any other library.
